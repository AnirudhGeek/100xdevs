Rent on Solana
=> Purpose of Rent: To prevent the blockchain from being clogged with inactive or unnecessary data, Solana charges rent for storing data.
=> Rent Calculation: Rent is based on the storage size and the duration the account remains on the blockchain.
=> Rent Exemption: If an account maintains a balance above a certain threshold, it becomes "rent-exempt," meaning it does not incur further rent charges. The rent paid is refundable when the account is closed.

Efficient Storage Management
=> Incentivizing Minimal Storage: The rent model encourages users to store only the necessary data, reducing blockchain bloat.
=> Removing Inactive Accounts: Accounts that fail to pay the required rent are eventually removed from the ledger, ensuring efficient use of blockchain resources.


Calculating Rent-Exempt Threshold
Methods to Calculate:
=> Solana CLI: Command-line interface tools.
=> Solana Web3.js Library: JavaScript library for interacting with the Solana blockchain.
=> Anchor's Space Constraint: A framework-specific approach for calculating space requirements for accounts.
