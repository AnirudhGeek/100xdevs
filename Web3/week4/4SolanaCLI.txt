RPC URL, Testnet, Devnet, and Mainnet

What is an RPC URL?
=> RPC (Remote Procedure Call) URLs allow applications like browsers, wallets, and users to interact with the Solana blockchain. 
=> By sending requests to an RPC URL, you can query the blockchain and perform various operations.

How to Use RPC URLs:
Mainnet: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
Devnet: https://api.devnet.solana.com
Testnet: https://api.testnet.solana.com

Clusters and Public RPC Endpoints :- https://solana.com/docs/references/clusters


Changing RPC URLs
Use the following commands to set the appropriate RPC URL for your environment:
    # Set RPC URL for Mainnet
    solana config set --url https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com

    # Set RPC URL for Devnet
    solana config set --url https://api.devnet.solana.com

    # Set RPC URL for Testnet
    solana config set --url https://api.testnet.solana.com

Solana Networks
=> Mainnet: The live Solana blockchain where real transactions occur. It’s secure and used for deploying production applications.
=> Testnet: A testing environment that mimics the mainnet but is used for testing applications before deploying them to the mainnet. It does not use real SOL.
=> Devnet: A development environment similar to the testnet but specifically for developers to experiment and test applications. You can freely request SOL from the Solana Devnet(https://faucet.solana.com/) Faucet for testing purposes.


Using Devnet and Testnet
=> Airdrop SOL: On Devnet, you can use the faucet to receive free SOL for testing.
=> Local Testing: Use the Solana Test Validator to start a local validator for testing applications without relying on external networks.

Solana Explorer
+>Explorer Tool: You can view transactions, account balances, and more on the Solana blockchain using the Solana Explorer, which supports Devnet, Testnet, Mainnet, and custom RPC URLs.
