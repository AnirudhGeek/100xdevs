JSON-RPC is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol encoded in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). It allows for communication between a client and a server over a network. JSON-RPC enables a client to invoke methods on a server and receive responses, similar to traditional RPC protocols but using JSON for data formatting.

As a user, you interact with the blockchain for two purposes - 

1. To send a `transction`
2. To fetch some details from the blockchain (balances etc)

In both of these, the way to interact with the blockchain is using JSON-RPC
