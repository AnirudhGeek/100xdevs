//Prop drilling occurs when you need to pass data from a higher level component down to a lower level component that i s several layers deep in the component tree. This often leads ti the following issues
//  1: Complexity :  You may have to pass props through many intermediate components that dont use the props themselves just to get them to the component that needs them.
//  2: Maintenance : It can make the code harder to maintain as changes in the props structure require updates in multiple components
